# zaria-projects-API
API for Zaria's scratch projects 
- for the frontend (user interface) of Zaria's scratch project share website


The idea hier is to create a backend that allows user sign up, sign in  and project adding, editing or removing. 
It has protected routes with Token validation. 

- DEPLOYED :D
